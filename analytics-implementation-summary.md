# Analytics and Performance Monitoring Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of analytics and performance monitoring for the CIN Foundation website. The implementation includes Firebase Analytics, Core Web Vitals monitoring, performance budgets, and testing tools.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Firebase Analytics
- Configured in `src/scripts/analytics.js`
- Tracks page views, user interactions, and custom events
- Includes enhanced measurement for better insights
- Configured to track Core Web Vitals metrics

### 2. Core Web Vitals Monitoring
- Implemented using the web-vitals library
- Tracks LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), FID (First Input Delay), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- Stores metrics in localStorage for debugging
- Reports metrics to Firebase Analytics

### 3. Performance Budget Monitoring
- Build-time checks in `scripts/performance-budget.js`
- Runtime monitoring in `src/scripts/performance-budget-monitor.js`
- Configured budgets for JavaScript, CSS, images, and fonts
- Alerts on budget violations

### 4. Error Tracking
- Global error handler for JavaScript errors
- Unhandled promise rejection tracking
- Stores errors in localStorage for debugging
- Reports errors to Firebase Analytics

### 5. Performance Dashboard
- Real-time performance monitoring dashboard
- Accessible via Ctrl+Shift+P keyboard shortcut
- Shows Core Web Vitals, resource usage, and performance timing
- Displays budget violations and recent errors

### 6. Testing Tools
- Browser-based test script in `src/scripts/test-analytics.js`
- Command-line test script in `scripts/test-analytics-cli.js`
- Verifies all components are properly configured
- Added `npm run test:analytics` script to package.json

### 7. Lighthouse CI Integration
- Configured in `lighthouserc.cjs`
- Runs performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO audits
- Enforces Core Web Vitals thresholds
- Integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Usage Instructions

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run analytics tests
npm run test:analytics

# Run Lighthouse CI
npm run lighthouse

# Run performance budget check
npm run performance:budget

# Run performance monitoring
npm run performance:monitor
```

### Viewing Performance Dashboard
1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the site with debug mode: http://localhost:3000?debug=true
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the performance dashboard

### Checking Analytics in Production
1. Deploy the site: `npm run firebase:deploy`
2. Visit the live site
3. Check Firebase Analytics console for data

## Next Steps
1. Set up GitHub Actions secrets for Lighthouse CI
2. Configure Firebase Analytics in the Firebase console
3. Set up alerts for performance budget violations
4. Create a performance monitoring dashboard in Firebase
5. Implement A/B testing using Firebase Analytics
