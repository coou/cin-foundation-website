# Design Document

## Overview

The CIN Foundation website is a high-performance, static single-page application (SPA) designed to serve as the authoritative digital presence for the Collective Intelligence Network. The design prioritizes intellectual credibility, visual sophistication, and seamless user experience while maintaining optimal performance through Firebase Hosting's global CDN.

The architecture follows a progressive disclosure approach, allowing visitors to engage at their preferred level of depth - from high-level vision to detailed technical documentation. The design aesthetic balances professional authority with forward-thinking innovation, reflecting the project's position at the intersection of AI, economics, and social systems.
