# Layout Fix Summary - CIN Foundation Website

## 🚨 Issues Identified and Resolved

### Primary Issue: Tailwind CSS Conflict
**Problem:** The website had conflicting Tailwind CSS dependencies that prevented proper compilation of styles.

**Root Cause:**
- `tailwindcss: ^3.4.0` in devDependencies 
- `@tailwindcss/postcss: ^4.1.11` in dependencies
- These versions are incompatible and caused Tailwind directives to not be processed

**Symptoms:**
- SVG icons were extremely large (not respecting w-5 h-5 classes)
- Responsive grid layouts not working
- Tailwind utility classes not being applied
- CSS warnings about unknown @tailwind and @apply directives

### Secondary Issue: CSS Warnings
**Problem:** Missing standard CSS properties alongside vendor prefixes.

**Specific Issue:**
- `-moz-appearance: none` without standard `appearance: none`
- Caused CSS validation warnings

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dependency Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Removed conflicting dependency
- "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.1.11" (from dependencies)

# Kept consistent Tailwind v3
- "tailwindcss": "^3.4.0" (in devDependencies)
```

### 2. CSS Standards Compliance
```css
/* Before */
button {
  -moz-appearance: none;
}

/* After */
button {
  -moz-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
}
```
